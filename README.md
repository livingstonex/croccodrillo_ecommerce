A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
You can start use this resource for learning purpose only.

1. Start by clonning the repo, make sure you already have flutter installed, if not go here: https://flutter.io/docs/get-started follow      the instructions and get flutter setup.

2. After cloning, open the containing folder in an IDE (preferably: intelliJ Idea).
3. Go to the pubspec.yaml file and run the command: flutter pub get. (note: if you are on intelliJ idea, as soon as you open the              pubspec.yaml file, its just a click away at the top of the page).
4. You can run the project in an emulator of your choice. (note: you have to have installed one, you can do so preferably by first            installing android studio as stated in the getting started guide link in step 1 above).
